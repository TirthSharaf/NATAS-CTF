**Natas CTF Automation with Python**

**Introduction**

This repository contains Python scripts to automate the Natas Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges developed by OverTheWire. Natas is a web security wargame designed to teach the basics of server-side web security. Each level of Natas presents its own website with increasing levels of difficulty.

**Natas Wargame Overview**

Natas Wargame explores various security issues commonly encountered in web applications. Some of the key topics covered include:

- Editing HTTP headers
- Command injections
- File inclusion vulnerabilities
- Weak encryption
- Cookie manipulation for user impersonation
- Bruteforce techniques
- SQL injections (including tautologies, blind injections, and timed blind injections)
